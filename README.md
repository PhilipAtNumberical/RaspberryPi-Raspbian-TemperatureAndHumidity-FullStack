# RaspberryPi-Raspbian-TemperatureAndHumidity-FullStack
This git is a project that I've built following a course teaching how to build a Full Stack Temperature and Humidity Recorder using Raspberry Pi 3, Raspbian OS and Adafruit DHT11 sensor; while results are recorded periodically (every 10 minutes) results are then updated and displayed numerically and graphically in a website. Website is currently hosted locally within the Raspberry Pi and can only be access within the local network. This project gave me a lot experience and expand my knowledge in working with embedded system in Linux environment.
